### Kameez<br/>
***
This page is about Kameez, a fictional brand of shirts and flannels. Our main colors are indigo blue and orange. We also chose gray for the background of the pages, in addition to black and white, to maintain an overall harmony on our page.<br/>

**Some highlights**:

* **Login Page**: The first page displayed is the login page, which contains a login form, the brand image, a title and slogan, as well as the classic email and password fields, followed by the password and session registration links, and the login button to access the dashboard page.<br/>

* **Sign up Page**: The next page is the user registration, which contains a user registration form, contains the brand image, a title, in addition to the classic fields such as name, surname, email, password, confirm password, in addition to a box with the terms and privacy policy that has a link that when clicked opens a modal that has the terms and privacy policy, followed by the register button, then also a link that says log in that will redirect you to the login page.

* **Change Password Page**: The Change Password page contains a password change form, a title, a subtitle, and fields such as Email, New Password, and Confirm New Password, followed by a Change Password button, followed by a button that will redirect you to the login screen.

* **Dashboard Page**: When you log in, the dashboard page will be displayed, which contains a navbar at the top with the brand name on the left side, the logout button on the right side, and the user's first and last name on the left. Then, at the bottom, we have a product table where we can add, edit, and delete products. This table contains the product data, its ID, name, price, size, stock, and actions.

* **Product View Page**: Clicking on the product shown in the product table will redirect you to the product view, where the navbar will also be displayed, followed by the data for the specific product, which contains the product image, its name, price, description, size and next to it whether the product is in stock or not, then at the end a button that will return you to the dashboard where the product table is located.

* **Page not found Page**: The page not found page displays an error message to the user, telling them that the page could not be found.

* In this project were applied: **VUE 3**, **VUETIFY** for the frontend, and for the backend **JSONSERVER** for its creation. and it has also been made responsive.<br/>
